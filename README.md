# CityTransport

Booking transports to move around the city.

- Clients can book a type of transport to move around the city.
- The administrators can add, modify and delete bycicles, scooters or electric scooters and mark them as available or not. They can also add routes and record them.
- Clients can create a new route or edit/delete routes already created by them. The fact of creating a route for a client, simulates the action of taking a certain vehicle in a location (start point) and leaving it in another location (end point).
